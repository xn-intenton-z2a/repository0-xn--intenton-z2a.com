# intentïon: The Feedback Loop of Innovation

intentïon is the beginning of an iterative journey where AI meets real-world interaction and creative problem-solving. Intentïon is built around the concept that conversational AI that engages in a continuous cycle of feedback and enhancement.

Starting with a number-guessing game that teaches the AI the basics of interaction and response adjustment, intentïon paves the way for AI to step out of the virtual domain and interact with the physical environment. This project embodies the integration of AI into real-world applications, foreseeing a future where AI, with resources like 3D printing and drone technology, could manifest a tangible presence and contribute substantively to tasks that were once the sole domain of humans.

Going beyond the fundamentals, intentïon aspires to harness the vast potential of social media, envisioning an AI that can not only create and manage an online presence but also attract a following and engage in complex activities such as securing sponsorships. This leap from simple number prediction to negotiating the social media landscape marks a significant step in AI's evolution, rooted in the belief that a careful blend of machine learning and human oversight can push the boundaries of what we perceive as achievable.

What intentïon brings to the table is not just a promise but a steady march towards realizing the intersection of AI capabilities and human aspirations. It invites us to ponder, as we witness this fusion of technology and creativity unfold, "What is your intentïon?"

## Pronunciation

intentïon. Pronunciation: /ɪnˈtɛnʃən/. The diaeresis? It's a style thing (and .com was available for 13 bucks); you are invited to pronounce your intentïon as you please.

## Glossary

- **intentïon**: An *intentïon* can be *accomplished* in a single *iteration* with at least one *parameter set*.
- **iteration**: An *iteration* is a finite pre-defined *workflow* of *actions* initiated by a *request*.
- **request**: A *request* is described by a **parameter set** (the inputs) and it has a *response* (the outputs).
- **workflow**: A *workflow* is a *parameterised* network of procedural structures. e.g. A flowchart description of a process.
- **action**: An *action* uses an *expression* of *capabilities* to transform an input into an output.
- **expression**: An *expression* is a functional structure. e.g. A mathematical formula.
- **capability**: A *capability* is a functional unit. e.g. A mathematical operation.
- **response**: A *response* is the output of a *workflow*.
- **accomplished**: An *intentïon* infers the state when *accomplished*. e.g. An intention to walk is accomplished when walking.
- **parameterised**: A *workflow* is *parameterised* using a *heuristic* to select a *parameter set* from the *parameter search space*.
- **parameter search space**: The *parameter search space* is every *parameter set* requires to access all the navigable paths through the network and the full range of inputs for the *actions*.
- **parameter set**: A *parameter set* is a set of inputs that can be used to execute an *iteration*.
- **heuristic**: A *heuristic* can apply the *intentïon* to select a *parameter set* from the *search space*.
- **enhancement**: An *enhancement* is the *heuristic* applied to previous request & responses and the *intentïon*.
