# intentïon: The Feedback Loop of Innovation

intentïon is the beginning of an iterative journey where AI meets real-world interaction and creative problem-solving. Intentïon is built around the concept that conversational AI that engages in a continuous cycle of feedback and enhancement.

Starting with a number-guessing game that teaches the AI the basics of interaction and response adjustment, intentïon paves the way for AI to step out of the virtual domain and interact with the physical environment. This project embodies the integration of AI into real-world applications, foreseeing a future where AI, with resources like 3D printing and drone technology, could manifest a tangible presence and contribute substantively to tasks that were once the sole domain of humans.

Going beyond the fundamentals, intentïon aspires to harness the vast potential of social media, envisioning an AI that can not only create and manage an online presence but also attract a following and engage in complex activities such as securing sponsorships. This leap from simple number prediction to negotiating the social media landscape marks a significant step in AI's evolution, rooted in the belief that a careful blend of machine learning and human oversight can push the boundaries of what we perceive as achievable.

What intentïon brings to the table is not just a promise but a steady march towards realizing the intersection of AI capabilities and human aspirations. It invites us to ponder, as we witness this fusion of technology and creativity unfold, "What is your intentïon?"

## Pronunciation

intentïon. Pronunciation: /ɪnˈtɛnʃən/. The diaeresis? It's a style thing (and .com was available for 13 bucks); you are invited to pronounce your intentïon as you please.

## Glossary

- **intentïon**: An *intentïon* can be *accomplished* in a single *iteration* with at least one *parameter set*.
- **iteration**: An *iteration* is a finite pre-defined *workflow* of *actions* initiated by a *request*.
- **request**: A *request* is described by a **parameter set** (the inputs) and it has a *response* (the outputs).
- **workflow**: A *workflow* is a *parameterised* network of procedural structures. e.g. A flowchart description of a process.
- **action**: An *action* uses an *expression* of *capabilities* to transform an input into an output.
- **expression**: An *expression* is a functional structure. e.g. A mathematical formula.
- **capability**: A *capability* is a functional unit. e.g. A mathematical operation.
- **response**: A *response* is the output of a *workflow*.
- **accomplished**: An *intentïon* infers the state when *accomplished*. e.g. An intention to walk is accomplished when walking.
- **parameterised**: A *workflow* is *parameterised* using a *heuristic* to select a *parameter set* from the *parameter search space*.
- **parameter search space**: The *parameter search space* is every *parameter set* requires to access all the navigable paths through the network and the full range of inputs for the *actions*.
- **parameter set**: A *parameter set* is a set of inputs that can be used to execute an *iteration*.
- **heuristic**: A *heuristic* can apply the *intentïon* to select a *parameter set* from the *search space*.
- **enhancement**: An *enhancement* is the *heuristic* applied to previous request & responses and the *intentïon*.

# Getting Started

# Infrastructure setup

A user with full IAM access to create a role will be needed to execute the Terraform scripts which in turn to create
the infrastructure level resources such as:
* The IAM role for the infrastructure user

Software required:
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
* Terragrunt
* AWS CDK

Terragrunt:
```shell
 % brew install terragrunt
```

Install the AWS CDK and ensure that version 2 is installed:
````bash
 % npm install -g aws-cdk
 % cdk --version
2.140.0 (build 46168aa)
````

Create the IAM role for the infrastructure user:
```shell
 % export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID='541134664601'
 % export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='...redacted...'
 % export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='...redacted...'
 % aws sts get-caller-identity                                            
{
    "UserId": "AIDAI5QAEKWGGXBYLAZ5G",
    "Account": "541134664601",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:user/polycode-deploy"
}
 % ./scripts/aws-create-infrastructure-role.sh
```

Add GitHub as an identity provider:
To be able to authenticate with OIDC from GitHub you will first need to set up GitHub as a federated identity provider in your AWS account.
1. To do that, navigate to the AWS IAM console and click on Identity Providers on the left-hand side.
2. Then, click on the Add provider button.
3. For Provider type, select OpenID Connect.
4. For Provider URL, enter https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
5. Click on Get thumbprint to get the thumbprint of the provider
6. For Audience, enter `sts.amazonaws.com`
   See:
   ![setup-add-identity-provider](docs/setup-add-identity-provider.png)

## First deployment

Bootstrap the stack with a state bucket
```bash
 % source ./scripts/aws-reset-assumed-role.sh
{
    "UserId": "AIDAX37RDWOMUJDFBDE6Y",
    "Account": "541134664601",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:user/polycode-default-account"
}
 % source ./scripts/aws-assume-deployment-role.sh
{
    "UserId": "AROA45MW5HDLRUMTIBS4I:WorkstationSession-for-antony",
    "Account": "887764105431",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::887764105431:assumed-role/intention-com-web-deployment-role/WorkstationSession-for-antony"
}
 % TODO...
````

The commit and push and the following jobs should run:
* `infrastructure-apply.yml` - Create infrastructure
* `dev-build-deploy.yml` - Build and deploy dev

The development side shall now be available at:

TODO website: http://test.com

## Manual infrastructure tear-down

Run the following in sequence:
```shell
 % source ./scripts/aws-assume-infrastructure-role.sh
 % terragrunt run-all destroy -auto-approve --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-working-dir ./infrastructure
 % ./scripts/aws-delete-infrastructure-role.sh
```

# Handy scripts

Cat the workflow and source files to datestamp the files in the export directory.
```shell
./export-source.sh
```

## Local access to AWS

You can assume the infrastructure role locally and use Terragrunt to create the infrastructure level resources by running:
```shell
 % source ./scripts/aws-reset-assumed-role.sh
{
    "UserId": "AIDAX37RDWOMUJDFBDE6Y",
    "Account": "541134664601",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:user/polycode-default-account"
}
 % source ./scripts/aws-assume-infrastructure-role.sh
 {
    "UserId": "AROA45MW5HDLQ2F53F3V4:WorkstationSession-for-antony",
    "Account": "541134664601",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::541134664601:assumed-role/intention-com-web-infrastructure-role/WorkstationSession-for-antony"
}
 % terragrunt apply -auto-approve --terragrunt-non-interactive --terragrunt-working-dir ./infrastructure
```

You can assume the deployment role locally by running:
```shell
 % source ./scripts/aws-reset-assumed-role.sh
{
    "UserId": "AIDAX37RDWOMUJDFBDE6Y",
    "Account": "541134664601",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:user/polycode-default-account"
}
 % source ./scripts/aws-assume-deployment-role.sh
{
    "UserId": "AROA45MW5HDLRUMTIBS4I:WorkstationSession-for-antony",
    "Account": "887764105431",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::887764105431:assumed-role/intention-com-web-deployment-role/WorkstationSession-for-antony"
}
 %
```

# Prompts

Website brief:
```shell
I want a single index.html file that is well-formed, declares
and adheres to all the latest accessibility guidelines and is
responsively rendered on all mainstream devices.

The page should render the word intentïon when the screen is
tapped (or mouse moved) for 3 seconds then fade out.

The word intentïon should be in dark grey (charcoal?) and
as wide as the horizontal viewport. The background should be
light grey, almost white with a hint of yellow (like fog
under bright sunlight).

The background (full screen, no text) should have the
attached images all fading in and out of transparency at
different rates.

Please show the HTML (all inline JS and CSS) the images
and any libraries you pull in would be links.
```

## CDK  Installation and initialisation of a project deployment directory

Create a deployment directory, initialise it with a CDK project then move the files to the root of the repository:
````bash
 % mkdir account
 % cd ./account
 % cdk init app --language java
Applying project template app for java
# Welcome to your CDK Java project!
...
 % rm -rf target README .gitignore
mv -v * ../.
cdk.json -> .././cdk.json
pom.xml -> .././pom.xml
src -> .././src
 % cd ..
 % rm -rf ./account
````

## The CDK README

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

Useful commands:

* `./mvnw package`     compile and run tests
* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
