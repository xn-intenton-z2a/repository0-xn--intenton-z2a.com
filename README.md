## Setup for AWS CDK

You'll need to have run `cdk bootstrap` to set up the environment for the CDK. This is a one-time setup per AWS account and region.
General administrative permissions are required to run this command. (NPM installed the CDK.)

In this example for user `antony-local-user` and `agentic-lib-github-actions-role` we would add the following
trust policy so that they can assume the role: `agentic-lib-deployment-role`:
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "sts:TagSession"],
			"Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::541134664601:role/agentic-lib-deployment-role"]
		}
	]
}
```

The `agentic-lib-github-actions-role` also needs the following trust entity to allow GitHub Actions to assume the role:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "StringLike": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:xn-intenton-z2a/s3-sqs-bridge:*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Create the IAM role with the necessary permissions to assume role from your authenticated user:
```bash

cat <<'EOF' > agentic-lib-deployment-trust-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:user/antony-local-user",
          "arn:aws:iam::541134664601:role/agentic-lib-github-actions-role"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name agentic-lib-deployment-role \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://agentic-lib-deployment-trust-policy.json
```

Add the necessary permissions to deploy `repository0-xn-intenton-z2a.com`:
```bash

cat <<'EOF' > agentic-lib-deployment-permissions-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudformation:*",
        "iam:*",
        "s3:*",
        "cloudtrail:*",
        "logs:*",
        "events:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "dynamodb:*",
        "sqs:*",
        "sts:AssumeRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
aws iam put-role-policy \
  --role-name agentic-lib-deployment-role \
  --policy-name agentic-lib-deployment-permissions-policy \
  --policy-document file://agentic-lib-deployment-permissions-policy.json
```

Assume the deployment role:
```bash

ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::541134664601:role/agentic-lib-deployment-role"
SESSION_NAME="agentic-lib-deployment-session-local"
ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT=$(aws sts assume-role --role-arn "$ROLE_ARN" --role-session-name "$SESSION_NAME" --output json)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Error: Failed to assume role."
  exit 1
fi
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo "$ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.Credentials.AccessKeyId')
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo "$ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.Credentials.SecretAccessKey')
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo "$ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.Credentials.SessionToken')
EXPIRATION=$(echo "$ASSUME_ROLE_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.Credentials.Expiration')
echo "Assumed role successfully. Credentials valid until: $EXPIRATION"
```
Output:
```log
Assumed role successfully. Credentials valid until: 2025-03-25T02:27:18+00:00
```

Check the session:
```bash

aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Output:
```json
{
  "UserId": "AROAX37RDWOM7ZHORNHKD:agentic-lib-deployment-session",
  "Account": "541134664601",
  "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::541134664601:assumed-role/agentic-lib-deployment-role/agentic-lib-deployment-session"
}
```

Check the permissions of the role:
```bash

aws iam list-role-policies \
  --role-name agentic-lib-deployment-role
```
Output (the policy we created above):
```json
{
  "PolicyNames": [
    "agentic-lib-deployment-permissions-policy"
  ]
}
```

An example of the GitHub Actions role being assumed in a GitHub Actions Workflow:
```yaml
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::541134664601:role/agentic-lib-deployment-role
          aws-region: eu-west-2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install -g aws-cdk
      - run: aws s3 ls --region eu-west-2
```

# Prompts

Website brief:
```shell
I want a single index.html file that is well-formed, declares
and adheres to all the latest accessibility guidelines and is
responsively rendered on all mainstream devices.

The page should render the word intentÃ¯on when the screen is
tapped (or mouse moved) for 3 seconds then fade out.

The word intentÃ¯on should be in dark grey (charcoal?) and
as wide as the horizontal viewport. The background should be
light grey, almost white with a hint of yellow (like fog
under bright sunlight).

The background (full screen, no text) should have the
attached images all fading in and out of transparency at
different rates.

Please show the HTML (all inline JS and CSS) the images
and any libraries you pull in would be links.
```
